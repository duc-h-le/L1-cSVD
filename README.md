# L1-cSVD
In this repo, an algorithm that performs L1-norm based compact Singular Value Decomposition (L1-cSVD) is implemented. The algorithm aims to robustly estimate singular values from a matrix corrupted by noise and gross and sparse outliers.

The decomposition is written to be
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\mathbf{X}\approx\mathbf{U}_{L1}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{L1}\mathbf{V}_{L1}^T&space;)
where ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\mathbf{U}_{L1}) and **V** are orthonormal and **\Sigma** is diagonal.
